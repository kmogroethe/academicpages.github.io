  * Plan and implement molecular epidemiology and population genetic studies of critical public-health organisms, including <i>Plasmodium</i> and <i>Aedes aegytpi</i> 
  * Design, implement, and oversee studies detecting critical public health pathogens from various vector spp.
    * Detection of <i>Plasmodium</i> species from <i>Anopholes</i> collected from the DRC
    * Detection of Flavivirus from <i>Aedes</i> collected from the DRC
  * Organize and process sequencing data from whole-genome sequencing platforms (Illumina, PacBio, Nanopore), amplicon deep sequencing, and molecular inversion probes (MIPs)
  * Coordinate analytical and educational efforts with key collaborators, both domestic and international, including members of countries’ National Malaria Control Program (Tanzania, Zambia). 
  * Prepare reports for grant submissions and contributed to manuscripts for publications; currently one first author manuscript in preparation.
