NF54 (Nijmegen Falciparum #54) is the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) isolate used in the wholeorganism
malaria vaccine called Sanaria® PfSPZ Vaccine. This vaccine, composed of radiation attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved sporozoites, provided 100% protection from homologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in a small safety and efficacy trial using intravenous administration. Clinical trials are underway to replicate these results and to determine efficacy against heterologous CHMI. The annotated genome of NF54 is not yet available, but will be an essential tool to interpret the result of efficacy studies, including the comparison of outcomes between homologous and heterologous CHMI, as well as protection against natural infections. The NF54 genome is likely very similar to that of the reference 3D7 Pf isolate, a clone from NF54. Analyses of publicly available wholegenome sequencing data for NF54, in the form of paired-end 100 bp Illumina reads, reveals the presence of 171 SNPs, of which 36 are nonsynonymous, confirming both the close relationship between the two genomes and the presence of a limited number of differences. However, the highly biased genome composition of Pf, together with its considerable repetitiveness, prevents the exhaustive characterization of those differences by read mapping, also an inadequate approach to identify potential genomic regions unique to NF54. In order to extensively characterize its genome, we have cultured NF54 and generated an 18,800 bp insert Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) library. This long-insert library was sequenced in four SMRT cells, with an average of 139,499 reads per cell, and an average mean and maximum read length of 7,433 and 48,513, respectively, for a total of over four gigabases of PacBio data. The genome is currently being assembled; a data set generated in a similar manner for another Pf isolate resulted in a nearly closed 24Mb genome assembly of 40 contigs. The newly generated NF54 assembly will be extensively characterized and compared with clinically relevant strains, including 3D7,as well as the 7G8 clone, currently being used in heterologous CHMI.
