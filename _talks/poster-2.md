Poster Session C

Genetic diversity in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is an obstacle to broadly efficacious malaria vaccines. The attenuated wholeorganism
malaria vaccine PfSPZ Vaccine is based on the African strain NF54, the parental stock of the reference Pf isolate 3D7. Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trials are underway to replicate initial promising results from homologous CHMI, and to assess heterologous protection using the South American strain 7G8. The degree of genetic dissimilarity between NF54 and strains used in CHMI, as well as to circulating strains in natural populations, can assist in the interpretation of protective efficacy, in the identification of additional challenge strains, and in the determination of whether regionalbased or multivalent whole-organism vaccines are needed. To this end, we utilized whole-genome sequencing data from 32 clinical isolates from Africa and southeast Asia (SEA), which we compared with NF54, 7G8, and NF135 (the latter an isolate from SEA and potential vaccine component). We generated SNP calls relative to 3D7 for a panel consisting of ~1 million validated variable positions in proteincoding genes. We identified an average of 4,200, 4,500 and 5,300 SNPs in samples from East and West Africa and SEA, respectively. Similarly to clinical samples from SEA, NF135 differs from 3D7 in 5,280 SNPs, while the difference between 7G8 and 3D7, at 4,722 SNPs, is intermediate between that of African and of SEA samples. With no SNPs called, NF54 is identical to 3D7 in all nucleotide positions in the panel. Principal coordinate analysis using genetic distances between samples showed a clear separation of strains from Asia and Africa according to the first two coordinates, with NF135 clustering with the former. NF54 clustered more closely with strains from West Africa, and 7G8 appears in the periphery of the African clade according to the first four components, suggesting clear differences but close ancestry between them. These results suggest that heterologous challenge studies demonstrating efficacy of PfSPZ in preventing infection against 7G8 would be very encouraging for the prospect of its efficacy in Africa.
